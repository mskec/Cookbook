# Pie Shell Script

> The perfect shell is as important for pie as it is for code.

## Ingredients

- 300 g all purpose flour
- 5/8 tsp salt
- 175 g cold butter
- 2 tbsp. cold water

## Directions

1. Stir together flour and salt.
2. Cut cold butter into pea-sized pieces (or use a cheese grater) and mix thoroughly into the dry ingredients.
3. Sprinkle 1 to 2 tbsp. cold water over part of the mixture, gently toss with a fork.
4. Form the mixture into a ball and place on a lightly floured surface.
5. Using a rolling pin, flatten from center to edges until the dough is 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter.
6. Carefully transfer the dough to a 9 inch (22 cm) pie plate.
7. Crimp the edge of the dough as desired.
8. Fill the shell with a pie filling of your choice!
